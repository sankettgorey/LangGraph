**Linear Regression**

**Definition:** Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The goal of linear regression is to create a linear equation that best predicts the value of the target variable based on the values of the predictors.

**Mathematical Representation:**

Let's consider a simple linear regression problem with one predictor variable, x. The relationship between the dependent variable, y, and the predictor variable, x, can be represented by the following linear equation:

y = β0 + β1x + ε

where:

* y is the dependent variable (target)
* β0 is the intercept or constant term
* β1 is the slope coefficient
* x is the independent variable (predictor)
* ε is the error term, which represents the random variation in the data

**Types of Linear Regression:**

There are two main types of linear regression:

1. **Simple Linear Regression:** This type of regression involves only one predictor variable.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression:** This type of regression involves multiple predictor variables.

**Assumptions of Linear Regression:**

For linear regression to be accurate, the following assumptions must be met:

1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the predictors should be linear.
2. Independence: Each observation should be independent of the others.
3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals (error term) should be constant across all levels of the predictor variables.
4. Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution.
5. No multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other.

**Linear Regression Algorithm:**

The linear regression algorithm involves the following steps:   

1. **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess the data, including scaling and centering the predictors if necessary.
2. **Model Fitting:** Use an optimization algorithm to find the best-fitting parameters (β0 and β1) that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE).
3. **Prediction:** Once the model is fitted, use it to make predictions for new data points.

**Common Methods for Estimating Linear Regression Parameters:** 

1. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):** This method uses the sum of squared errors as the loss function and minimizes it using an optimization algorithm.
2. **Weighted Least Squares:** This method is used when the predictor variables have different weights or importance.
3. **Regularized Linear Regression:** This method adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.

**Common Metrics for Evaluating Linear Regression Performance:**

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
2. **R-Squared (R2):** Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the predictors.
3. **Coefficient of Determination (R2):** Similar to R2, but measures the proportion of variation in the residuals.

**Common Applications of Linear Regression:**

1. **Predicting Continuous Outcomes:** Linear regression can be used to predict continuous outcomes such as house prices or stock prices.
2. **Regression Analysis:** Linear regression is often used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more predictor variables.
3. **Time Series Analysis:** Linear regression can be used to forecast future values in time series data.

**Code Implementation:**

Here's an example implementation of linear regression using Python and scikit-learn library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Define the data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 11])

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x.reshape(-1, 1))

# Evaluate the model
mse = np.mean((y - predictions) ** 2)
r2 = model.score(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)
print("MSE:", mse)
print("R2:", r2)
```
